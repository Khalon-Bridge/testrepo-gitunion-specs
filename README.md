## Feature: Fractional Asset Ownership API
### Feature Overview
The Fractional Asset Ownership API enables users to purchase and own fractions of high-value assets. This feature addresses the issue of high entry barriers in traditional investment opportunities by allowing users to invest with smaller capital outlays.

### Problem It Solves
Access to investments in assets such as real estate, art, or expensive equities is typically reserved for individuals or entities with significant capital. This API democratizes access by fractionalizing investments, allowing broader participation and diversified portfolios with lower risk and capital commitment.

### Benefits
- **Accessibility:** Opens investment opportunities to a wider audience, including those with limited capital.
- **Diversification:** Investors can spread their risk by owning fractions of multiple assets.
- **Liquidity:** Fractional ownership can potentially increase market liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Reduces the costs associated with large transactions by splitting assets into affordable shares.
- **Inclusion:** Promotes financial inclusion by lowering the threshold for investment.
